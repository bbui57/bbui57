# 🏋️‍♂️ Brian Bui

Hello! My name is Brian, I aim to direct my work towards integrating AI/ML into biological and molecular datasets in order to further developments in understanding human biology and disease.

- I am currently enrolled in a postbacc program intending to receive my Master's Degree in Software Engineering by the end of 2027.
- I am currently working on self-developing my knowledge in cybersecurity and receiving my CompTIA Security+ certification in the near future.
- I have years of experience in healthcare and customer satisfaction from my undergraduate studies and recent field of work.


> 💡 I am currently seeking hands-on opportunities to develop and apply my skills mainly in the AI/ML field, but also in general software engineering and cybersecurity.
